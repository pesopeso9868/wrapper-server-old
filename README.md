# Wrapper
Wrapper is a rewrite of the web endpoints on GoAnimate (a.k.a. Vyond) in JavaScript. 

# Prerequisites
- [`node.js`](https://nodejs.org/)
- `npm`
  - `npm is included with node.js`
- `a brain`

# Asset server
By default, the asset server is hosted on the [Wrapper: Online](https://wrapper.online/) website.
If you would like to host the asset server yourself, then click [here](https://github.com/2Epik4u/Wrapper-Online-Assets), follow `README.md` and change `config.json` to reflect the change.

# Start
Ensure you have everything listed in the prerequisites, then clone or download this repository. Once finished, unzip the folder (if needed) and execute the following commands in your command prompt:
